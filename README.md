## Usage Notes and Examples
* As a user, from my computer, I can access my profile and search for job from one centralized place.
* As a user, I can login to my profile and see all jobs I have saved in the past.
* As a user, I can remove jobs that I am no longer interested in.
* As a user, I can add notes about the specific job the note is attached to.
* As a user, I can update notes about the specific job the note is attached to.
* As a user, I can delete notes about the specific job the note is attached to.
* As a developer, I can test to see if I login successfully so that I can test if my hashing and authorization is running correctly.
* As a developer, I can hash the userâ€™s data so that they are protected from malicious software.
* As a developer, I can have modular functions so that my code is not repetitive and is clean when it comes to being read by another developer.
* As a developer, I can log errors so that I know of any potential bugs or edge cases.
